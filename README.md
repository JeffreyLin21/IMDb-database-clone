Movies have been a part of society for over a century and still remain a vital part of humanities history. Whether based on historical events or a fictional world beyond our wildest dreams, movies often embody its creators' creativity and beliefs and provide its viewers with a meaningful message by the end of it. 

As a result, I will be basing my dataset on the statistics and information available on the IMDb site, which contains nearly every movie produced in the past century. This data set contains information such as the movie title, genres, language, country of origin, year released, director, and short descriptions. Needless to say, this data set extensively covers most, if not all, movies that have ever been released, as it contains over 800,000 entries. The link for the data set can be found at the link above. 

Along with the historical significance of films, my own personal experience with movies is what made me want to base my dataset off films. As a child, going to the movie theatre with my dad, would be the current day equivalent of being gifted a new phone. In fact, I remember the first time going to the theatre with my dad very vividly as if it was yesterday. Iron Man 3, had just been released and the thought of watching it didn't even cross my mind. Moreover, it was even a school night, so the idea of going anywhere at 8 pm seemed like a ridiculous thought at the time. Nevertheless, my dad surprised me with movie tickets last minute, and he and I had a wonderful experience. It was these moments in my life that made me so fond of movies. As a result, this data set allowed me to explore my love for movies even further.
